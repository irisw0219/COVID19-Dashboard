# COVID19-Dashboard
COVID19 JHU Data Visualisation in R


## Introduction
This tutorial was developed for visualizing the COVID19 data in R. Using open source Leaflet API, just a few lines of code will get you flying into web-mapping. [View map](https://irisw0219.github.io/covid19-data-viz/)


## Getting Started
Code for generating the interactive map is in the Jupyter notebook. [View Code](https://github.com/irisw0219/covid19-data-viz/blob/master/COVID19%20Data%20Visualisation.ipynb)
